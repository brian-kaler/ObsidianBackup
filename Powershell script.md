Write a powershell script that runs Dell Command update using the dcu-cli.exe utility.  The script should apply all updates on the machine and suppress rebooting.  It should log all activity including the specific drivers updated and return the results at the end of the script.As an AI language model, I don't have the dcu-cli.exe utility installed on my system, so I can't provide you with a fully functional PowerShell script. However, I can provide you with a template that you can modify to suit your needs. Here is an example PowerShell script that runs Dell Command Update and logs all activity:

```
# Define the path to the dcu-cli.exe utility
$dcuPath = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Dell\Command Update\dcu-cli.exe"

# Define the command-line arguments for running Dell Command Update
$args = "/applyUpdates /silent /suppressReboot /logFilePath:C:\Temp\DellCommandUpdate.log"

# Run Dell Command Update with the specified arguments
Start-Process -FilePath $dcuPath -ArgumentList $args -Wait

# Read the log file and extract the details of updated drivers
$logData = Get-Content "C:\Temp\DellCommandUpdate.log" | Select-String "Updating component:" | Out-String

# Display the results
Write-Host "The following drivers were updated:"
$logData
```

In this script, we define the path to the dcu-cli.exe utility and specify command-line arguments to apply all updates silently and suppress rebooting. We also specify a log file path where all activity will be logged.

We then run Dell Command Update using `Start-Process` cmdlet and wait for it to finish.

After that, we read the log file using `Get-Content` cmdlet and extract details of updated drivers using `Select-String`. Finally, we display the results using `Write-Host`.

Please note that this is just a template, so you may need to modify it according to your specific requirements and environment.


Write a powershell script that parses a log file and filters output return code and other common errors or events.  The return object should contain at least 3 fields, the
