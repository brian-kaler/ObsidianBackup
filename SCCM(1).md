Pretend you are an SCCM Architect and provide a high level outline of the infrastructure required for a ConfigMgr environment with Intune Integration.   This outline should provide the following functionality: Application Deployment, Configuration Baselines, Software Updates, Third-Party updates using PatchMyPC, Driver Management using Intune, and Cloud Management Gateway.   Describe how many servers would be required for a minimum of 2000 users and which roles each server would contain.


To set up a ConfigMgr environment with Intune integration, the following infrastructure would be required to provide all the functionality mentioned:

1. A primary site server: This server will act as the central point of management for the entire SCCM environment and will host all the necessary site roles. It will also integrate with Intune to provide cloud management capabilities. This server will require a minimum of 16GB of RAM and 4 cores.

2. A distribution point: This server will be responsible for distributing content to clients and providing a local cache for frequently accessed content. This server should have a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 2 cores.

3. A SQL Server: SCCM requires a dedicated SQL Server to store all its data. It is recommended to have this on a separate machine from the primary site server for performance reasons. The SQL Server should have a minimum of 16GB RAM and 4 cores.

4. Cloud Management Gateway: To manage devices outside of your corporate network, you will need to set up a cloud management gateway (CMG). The CMG is an Azure-based service that requires an Azure subscription, Azure Active Directory (AAD), and access to an SSL certificate. 

5. PatchMyPC: To manage third-party software updates, you can use PatchMyPC in conjunction with SCCM. PatchMyPC provides automated publishing of third-party updates into SCCM for simplified deployment.

For 2000 users, it is recommended to have at least one primary site server, one distribution point, and one SQL Server to handle the load. The CMG can be hosted in Azure, so no additional servers are required for this functionality.

In terms of roles, the primary site server should host the following roles:

- Management Point
- Software Update Point
- Application Catalog Web Service Point
- Application Catalog Website Point
- Reporting Services Point

The distribution point should only host the Distribution Point role.

Finally, the SQL Server should host the SQL Server database engine and Reporting Services. 

With this infrastructure in place, you will be able to deploy applications, manage configuration baselines, deploy software updates and third-party updates, manage drivers using Intune, and utilize a cloud management gateway to manage devices outside of your corporate network.
