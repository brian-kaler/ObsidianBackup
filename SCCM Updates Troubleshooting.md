Introduction

As an SCCM expert with a specialization in WSUS and delivering windows updates with configuration manager, troubleshooting clients that have not received their updates is a frequent occurrence. In this document, I will outline the software update troubleshooting process for such a machine, including the log files that should be read and the order in which they should be reviewed.

Step 1: Verify Software Update Deployment

The first step in troubleshooting a client that has not received its updates is to verify the software update deployment. This can be done by checking the deployment status of the update in SCCM. To do this:

1. Open the SCCM console and navigate to Monitoring > Deployments.
2. Locate the deployment for the missing software update.
3. Review the deployment status to ensure that it has been successful.

If there are any errors or warnings associated with the deployment, they will be listed here. It is important to address any issues before moving on to other troubleshooting steps.

Step 2: Check Client Status

The next step is to check the client status. This can be done by reviewing client logs on the affected machine. The following logs should be reviewed in order:

1. WindowsUpdate.log: This log file provides detailed information about Windows Update activity on the client machine, including download and installation progress, errors, and warnings.
2. C:\Windows\CCM\Logs\WUAHandler.log: This log file provides information about how configuration manager interacts with Windows Update Agent (WUA) on the client machine.
3. C:\Windows\CCM\Logs\UpdatesDeployment.log: This log file provides information about how configuration manager deploys software updates to clients.

Reviewing these logs will help identify any issues that may be preventing updates from being installed on the client machine.

Step 3: Check Group Policy Settings

If no issues are identified in Step 1 or Step 2, it may be necessary to check the group policy settings on the client machine. The following group policy settings are related to software updates and should be reviewed:

1. Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update
2. Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Installer

Ensure that these policies are configured correctly and are not preventing updates from being installed on the client machine.

Step 4: Check Firewall Settings

If all other troubleshooting steps have been completed and no issues have been identified, it may be necessary to check the firewall settings on the client machine. Specifically, ensure
