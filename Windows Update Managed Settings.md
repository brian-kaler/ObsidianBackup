Very similiar settings mentioned, not the full list but to keep values as unconfigured.


Filter Windows 11 on TargetReleaseVersion?
Does the activation (win10 pro) effect this upgrade.

	We went through an absurd amount of testing for this and these are the settings we came up with. Do not set any other WSUS/Windows Update/Windows update for business settings or they will conflict and re-enable dual scan:

Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/System/Specify settings for optional component installation and component repair

-   â€‹ Never attempt to download payload from Windows Update - Disabled
    
-   Download repair content and optional features directly from Windows Update instead of Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) - Enabled
    

Windows Components/Store

-   Only display the private store within the Microsoft Store - Disabled
    
-   Turn off Automatic Download and Install of updates - Disabled
    
-   Turn off the offer to update to the latest version of Windows - Enabled
    
-   Turn off the Store application - Disabled
    

Windows Components/Windows Update

-   Remove access to use all Windows Update features Enabled
    

The MECM agent will set a few more WU policies, don't try and set those manually.

These settings will:

-   Only allow windows updates to come from SCCM.
    
-   Allow administrators to install optional features from Microsoft directly without it being in WSUS, like RSAT tools
    
-   Allow Store access (we have two GPOs, one allows only the private store)
    
-   Disable the ability for users to run dual scan (which would reach out to microsoft directly)
```




Path: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings

Type: REG_QWORD:

Setting: SvOfferDeclined

Value: 0 disable banner and blocks in-place upgrades to Windows 11.

The value of the registry key is inconsequential as long as it exists. For unification, the suggestion would be to make the value 0.


## update 5/24/2023

SvOfferDeclined is depreciated!
