Title: Resolving the Issue of Mailto Links Not Opening in Outlook 365

Introduction:
When a user encounters an issue where mailto links do not open in their preferred mail client, such as Outlook 365, it can hinder their productivity and disrupt their workflow. To address this problem, we will explore three potential solutions: utilizing the default applications XML method, implementing a Group Policy Object (GPO), or creating a Configuration Manager baseline. Each solution offers distinct advantages and drawbacks, and we will discuss them in detail. Additionally, we will highlight any security concerns associated with these solutions.

Solution 1:  Default application XML file.
The default applications XML method allows for the configuration of default apps for file types and protocols. 

1. Create an XML file with the association mapping mailto to the correct ProgID.

2. The XML would look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<DefaultAssociations>
  <Association Identifier="mailto" ProgId="Outlook.URL.mailto.15" ApplicationName="Outlook 2016" />
</DefaultAssociations>
```

3. Add the path to the configuration file in a GPO setting (see screenshot)

OR

3. Create a configuration manager baseline to perform similar steps using a command line tool included in Windows known as DISM.  Functionally the result is the same.

Pros:
- Relatively simple implementation.
- Configuration Manager solution would only require an internet connection to download through cloud management gateway.
Cons:
- GPO solution Requires a VPN connection to support distribution of the XML file, at least once.
- Windows 10 only supports a single XML configuration at a time.

There are some security concerns as file associations are a common vector of attack for malicious attackers.

  - Phishing attacks: If a malicious website or email tries to exploit a vulnerability in Outlook, having it set as the default mail client could increase the risk of falling victim to such attacks.
  - Malicious file attachments: Opening emails directly in Outlook might expose users to potential malware or viruses if they inadvertently open malicious attachments without proper caution.
  - Privacy issues: Depending on user settings and permissions granted to Outlook, there may be privacy concerns regarding data collection or sharing of personal information with Microsoft or third-party applications integrated with Outlook.


To resolve the issue of mailto links not opening in Outlook 365 as the preferred mail client for all users in a Windows 10 environment, you can make use of Group Policy or Configuration Manager to deploy the necessary changes. 

Solution 1: Group Policy

1. Open the Group Policy Management console on a domain controller.
2. Create a new Group Policy Object (GPO) or edit an existing one.
3. Navigate to User Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Default Applications.
4. Locate and enable the "Set default email application" policy.
5. Set the default email application to "Outlook" or specify the path to Outlook.exe if necessary.
6. Apply the GPO to the desired user organizational unit (OU) or domain.

Pros:
- Centralized management: The GPO allows for easy deployment and management of settings across multiple users/computers within an OU or domain.
- No additional software required: Utilizing built-in Windows Group Policy functionality does not require any additional software installations.

Cons:
- Limited control: GPOs may not provide granular control over specific user preferences, as it sets a global default for all users within an OU or domain.
- Requires Active Directory infrastructure: This solution requires a Windows Server Active Directory environment.

Solution 2: Configuration Manager Baseline

1. Open the Configuration Manager console and navigate to Assets and Compliance > Compliance Settings > Configuration Baselines.
2. Create a new baseline, providing it with an appropriate name and description.
3. Add a new configuration item to the baseline, selecting "Registry Setting" as the setting type.
4. Configure the registry setting with the following details:
   - Hive: HKEY_CURRENT_USER
   - Key Path: Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Associations\UrlAssociations\mailto\UserChoice
   - Value Name: ProgId
   - Value Type: REG_SZ
   - Value: Outlook.URL.mailto.15 (for Outlook 2013 and later versions)
5. Deploy the baseline to the desired collection of Windows 10 devices.

Pros:
- Granular control: Configuration Manager allows for more specific targeting and customization of settings based on collections of devices or users.
- Can be used in non-domain environments: Unlike Group Policy, Configuration Manager can be used in non-domain environments as long as the clients are managed by Configuration Manager.



Cons:
- Requires additional infrastructure and expertise: Setting up and managing a Configuration Manager environment requires additional resources, including a
