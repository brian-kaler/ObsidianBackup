Objectives:
1. To ensure that all applications are deployed correctly and successfully in MECM.
2. To identify any issues or errors during the application deployment process.
3. To ensure that the application lifecycle is properly managed and maintained in MECM.

Procedures and Scope:
1. Conduct a pre-deployment review of the application package and its dependencies to ensure that all necessary files are included.
2. Deploy the application to a test group of devices to verify successful installation and functionality.
3. Monitor deployment progress and troubleshoot any issues that arise during the deployment process.
4. Conduct a post-deployment review to ensure that all devices have successfully installed the application.
5. Monitor application usage and update as needed throughout its lifecycle.

Findings and Conclusions:
1. Successful deployment of applications is crucial to maintaining device performance and user satisfaction.
2. Errors or issues during deployment can lead to delays, frustration, and potential downtime for users.
3. Regular auditing of application deployments helps ensure proper management of the application lifecycle.

Recommendations:
1. Develop a standardized process for deploying applications in MECM, including pre and post deployment reviews.
2. Regularly review application usage data to identify opportunities for optimization or retirement of outdated applications.
3. Conduct a comprehensive inventory of all applications used in the organization to gain a complete understanding of the current application landscape.
4. Develop metrics to measure application usage, such as frequency, number of users, and overall impact on business processes.
5. Analyze the data collected from application usage metrics to identify patterns and trends that indicate areas for optimization or retirement.
6. Prioritize optimization or retirement efforts based on the analysis of application usage data, focusing on those applications that are underutilized, redundant, or no longer relevant to business needs.
7. Develop a plan for retiring outdated applications, including communication with end-users and IT staff, data migration strategies, and any necessary training for replacement applications.
8. Implement regular review processes to ensure ongoing optimization and retirement efforts are effective in improving efficiency and reducing costs.
9. Consider leveraging automation tools to assist with the collection and analysis of application usage data to streamline the review process and improve accuracy.
10. Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the auditing process and make adjustments as needed to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Write a list of audit tasks in SCCM (ConfigMgr)  based around applications, configuration items, software updates, and configuration.  Each item should be brief.  Another list should be created based on this list that contains how the item is evaluated.Audit Tasks:

Applications:
1. Verify that all applications are up-to-date.
2. Check if any applications are not being used.
3. Ensure that all applications are deployed to the correct collection.
4. Check if any applications have failed installation or uninstallation.

Configuration Items:
1. Verify that all configuration items are up-to-date.
2. Ensure that all configuration items are deployed to the correct collection.
3. Check if any configuration items have failed evaluation.
4. Verify that all required configuration items are present.

Software Updates:
1. Ensure that all software updates are up-to-date.
2. Check if any software updates have failed installation or deployment.
3. Verify that all required software updates are deployed to the correct collection.
4. Confirm that all applicable security patches have been applied.

Configuration:
1. Verify that SCCM (ConfigMgr) configurations are up-to-date and correct.
2. Ensure that SCCM (ConfigMgr) is configured according to best practices and industry standards.
3. Check if there are any conflicts between SCCM (ConfigMgr) settings and other systems used in the organization.
4. Confirm that SCCM (ConfigMgr) configurations meet organizational requirements.

How the Item is Evaluated:

Applications:
1. Compare application version numbers to determine if they're up-to-date
2. Conduct an analysis of application usage logs
3. Review deployment settings and app inventory reports
4. Review logs for errors during installation or uninstallation

Configuration Items:
1. Compare configuration item version numbers to determine if they're up-to-date
2. Review deployment settings and collection membership rules
3.Check compliance status messages in SCCM console
4.Check date of last evaluation for each configuration item

Software Updates:
1.Compare software update version numbers to determine if they're up-to-date
2.Confirm successful installation using update compliance reports
3.Verify adherence to deployment schedules, deadlines, and maintenance windows
4.Check update compliance status messages in SCCM console

Configuration:
1. Review SCCM (ConfigMgr) settings against documented best practices
2.Conduct a thorough system review to identify configuration issues
3.Confirm that SCCM (ConfigMgr) configurations comply with organizational policies and procedures
4.Verify that SCCM (ConfigMgr) configurations are compatible with other systems used in the organization

Create a list of items for a System Center (ConfigMgr) audit focusing on documentation and another list with evaluation criteria for the first list.List of items for a System Center (ConfigMgr) audit focusing on documentation:
1. Configuration management plan
2. System Center installation and configuration documentation
3. Inventory of all managed resources, including hardware and software assets
4. Security policies and procedures documentation
5. Backup and recovery documentation
6. Patch management policies and procedures documentation
7. Network architecture diagrams with ConfigMgr components identified
8. Change management policies and procedures documentation
9. User access control policies and procedures documentation

Evaluation criteria for the first list:
1. Is there a comprehensive configuration management plan in place?
2. Are installation and configuration documents up-to-date?
3. Is the inventory of all managed resources accurate and complete?
4. Are security policies and procedures documented in detail?
5. Is there an effective backup and recovery plan in place?
6. Are patch management policies and procedures comprehensive?
7. Are network architecture diagrams up-to-date with ConfigMgr components identified accurately?
8. Are change management policies and procedures documented appropriately?
9. Are user access control policies and procedures well-documented?
