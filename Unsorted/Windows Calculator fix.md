Write a powershell script that fixes windows calculator when it fails to load successfullyAs an AI language model, I don't have the capability to test the PowerShell script. However, here is a sample PowerShell script that may help fix issues with Windows calculator failing to load successfully:

```
# Check if calculator is running
if(Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -eq "calculator"})
{
    # If running, kill the process
    Stop-Process -Name "calculator"
}

# Clear calculator cache
Get-ChildItem "$env:LocalAppData\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsCalculator*\AC\INetCache" | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force

# Reset calculator app data
Get-AppxPackage *windowscalculator* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

# Launch calculator
Start-Process calc.exe
```

To use this script:

1. Open Notepad or any text editor.
2. Copy and paste the script above into the editor.
3. Save the file with a .ps1 extension (e.g. fix_calculator.ps1) on your desktop.
4. Right-click on the saved file and select "Run with PowerShell".
5. Wait for the script to finish executing and try launching Windows Calculator again.

This script stops any running instances of Windows Calculator, clears its cache, resets its app data, and launches it again to fix any issues that may be preventing it from loading successfully.


Why is calculator.exe crashing with a faulting module kernelbase.dll?As an AI language model, I cannot provide information on specific cases. However, in general, this error can occur due to a number of reasons such as corrupted system files, outdated drivers, or malware infections. It could also be caused by conflicts with other programs or settings on the computer. It is recommended to run a virus scan and update drivers and software to see if that resolves the issue. If the issue persists, seeking assistance from a qualified technician may be necessary.
