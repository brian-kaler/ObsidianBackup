Write a recommendation for an approach to fix a missing wifi driver using a Dell Command update script that I wrote for this purpose.   The script requires the machine be powered on and connected  via an ethernet jack with an active internet connection.  We should power on as many devices as possible at the top of each hour until we've exhausted all the possible devices.  Factors that may impact the process positively include if we can obtain access to the inventory details such as when they entered inventory.   Joe and Dan can reach out to me directly for the project and work with their schedules to complete the full 240 devices.


Hi Mike/Jim,

As I stated in Teams, I've created a Dell Command update script that can fix this problem without the user being logged on. 

However, there are a few requirements for this script to work:

Firstly, the machine should be powered on.
Secondly, it needs to be connected to the internet via an ethernet jack. 

I recommend powering on as many devices as possible at the top of each hour until we've exhausted all the possible devices.  The process takes approximately 15-20 minutes, so we'll need a full hour to both run the process and perform verification.  

To make this process smoother, it's best if we can obtain access to inventory details such as when they entered inventory. This will help us target specific devices and complete the project more efficiently.

If this sounds like an actionable plan, I can reach out to Joe or Dan to collaborate on a schedule to get all the devices ready. Together, we can fix this issue across all 240 devices.
