write a poem that rhymes with monette

In a garden of roses, so sweet and fine
There blooms a flower, a monette divine
Its petals soft, like silk they shine
In the summer sun, it's truly divine

The monette stands tall, with grace and poise
Its beauty unmatched, its scent a joy
In the breeze it dances, like a playful toy
A sight to behold, for every girl and boy

Oh monette, how you enchant us all
With your delicate beauty, so fine and small
A treasure in nature's grand hall
Forever cherished, by one and all

So let us praise this lovely flower
That brings such joy in every hour
May it always bloom with power 
And fill our hearts with its sweet shower.
