write a powershell script that finds devices missing drivers in device managerAs an AI language model, I don't have access to device manager and hardware devices. However, here is a sample PowerShell script that can be used to find devices missing drivers based on the device's class:

```
# Get all devices in the system
$devices = Get-PnpDevice

# Loop through each device and check if it is missing drivers
foreach ($device in $devices) {
    # Check if the device has a problem code indicating driver issues
    if ($device.Status -eq "Error" -or $device.Status -eq "Unknown") {
        Write-Output "Device '$($device.FriendlyName)' is missing a driver."
    }
}
```

You can also filter the devices by their class to narrow down the search. For example, if you only want to find missing drivers for network adapters, you can modify the script as follows:

```
# Get all network adapters in the system
$adapters = Get-PnpDevice -Class Net

# Loop through each adapter and check if it is missing drivers
foreach ($adapter in $adapters) {
    # Check if the adapter has a problem code indicating driver issues
    if ($adapter.Status -eq "Error" -or $adapter.Status -eq "Unknown") {
        Write-Output "Network adapter '$($adapter.FriendlyName)' is missing a driver."
    }
}
```

Note that this script may not work for all types of devices or situations where drivers are missing. It's always best to check with your hardware manufacturer or use a dedicated tool for managing your device drivers.
